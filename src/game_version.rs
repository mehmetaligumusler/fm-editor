//! Game version, storefront and build selector + runtime dispatch.
//!
//! Every schema lookup routes through a `&'static VersionedSchemas` that
//! belongs to the game being read: `FmProcess::schemas()` on the worker side,
//! the attached game's build on the UI side. There is no process-global
//! "active version", so several games open at once cannot cross schemas.
//!
//! A schema is selected per [`GameBuild`] — a release ([`GameVersion`]) as
//! shipped by one storefront ([`Storefront`]). The Game Pass build of a
//! release is a different binary from the Steam one (Microsoft GDK instead
//! of Steamworks), so its module hash and module-relative RVAs can differ
//! even when the struct layouts match.
//!
//! Detection is automatic: FM24, FM26 and FM27 all run as `fm.exe`, so
//! `process::running_games()` lists them and reads each one's on-disk
//! module path — the install directory always contains the release year,
//! and a Game Pass install is recognisable by its install location — to
//! determine which build, and so which schema, it uses.
//!
//! Adding a build (e.g. FM26 on Game Pass) is a new `GameBuild` variant,
//! its arms in the `GameBuild` matches, and its schema static under
//! `crate::fields::`.
